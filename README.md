Exploring Yelp Review and Business Data

Yelp has become an integral part of our lives when finding local businesses. People rely on Yelp's reviews and recommendations from restaurants to hair salons to make informed decisions. As a result, Yelp's business data has become a goldmine of information for businesses and researchers alike. In this blog, we explore the vast possibilities of Yelp's business data by analyzing a subset of Yelp's data to uncover insights into businesses, cities, and categories. We delve into how to graph modeling can help us understand the relationships between businesses, categories, and cities, and how this understanding can help businesses optimize their operations and improve their customer experience. Join us on this journey as we explore the world of Yelp's business data and uncover valuable insights that can help businesses thrive.

By analyzing the relationships between businesses, customers, and their reviews using MongoDB, Neo4j, and Redis, this project aims to uncover hidden patterns and insights that can help businesses understand how customers interact with their products and services. The goal is to help businesses identify influential customers, detect anomalies in customer behavior, and understand the impact of customer sentiment on their business. Through this project, businesses can make data-driven decisions that lead to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, business success
